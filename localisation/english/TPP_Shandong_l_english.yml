 ### DOGMEAT GENERAL ###
 #######################
 Dogmeat_desc: "§Y"The Dogmeat General"§! \n\nOfficially declared dead years ago, Zhang Zongchang’s return to power has only deepened his legend. Once the undisputed master of Shandong, Zhang built his rule on corruption, opium revenues, mercenary armies, and unapologetic brutality. That such a man could vanish from history—only to reappear and seize control once more—seems less an anomaly than a confirmation of the chaotic age China endures. \n\nZhang is no ideologue, reformer, or nationalist visionary. He believes in power as a personal possession, to be taken, spent, and defended with guns and silver. His administration is infamous for its excesses: public executions as spectacle, state-sanctioned vice as revenue, and governance conducted through whim, intimidation, and loyalty purchased outright. Yet for all his absurdities, Zhang possesses a sharp instinct for survival and an unflinching willingness to do whatever is necessary to remain in control. \n\nMocked by intellectuals and feared by civilians, Zhang cultivates his reputation deliberately. His erratic behaviour, crude poetry, and open contempt for convention serve a purpose—confusing rivals, discouraging conspiracies, and reinforcing the idea that resistance is futile. Under his rule, order exists not through institutions, but through fear and unpredictability. \n\nWhether Zhang Zongchang represents the final grotesque echo of the warlord era or its most enduring embodiment remains uncertain. What is clear is that as long as the Dogmeat General lives, China’s fate will be decided not by ideals or constitutions, but by the man who holds the gun longest."

 sndflav.1.t: "Zhang Zongchang Returns from the Dead!"
 sndflav.1.d: "Against all expectations—and much to the disbelief of observers across China—Zhang Zongchang, the infamous “Dogmeat General,” has re-emerged to seize control of Shandong, despite having long been believed dead. \n\nRumors of Zhang’s demise had circulated for years, bolstered by reports of assassination, exile, or quiet execution. Yet today, those rumours have been shattered. Zhang appeared suddenly in Jinan, flanked by armed loyalists and mercenary troops, declaring himself the rightful ruler of Shandong once more. Local authorities collapsed almost immediately, either fleeing or pledging allegiance to the returning warlord. \n\nKnown for his brutality, eccentric behaviour, and utter disregard for convention, Zhang Zongchang once ruled Shandong as a personal fiefdom—financed through corruption, opium, and raw violence. His unexpected return has sent shockwaves through China’s already fragile political landscape, raising fears of renewed warlord conflict and unchecked chaos in the north. \n\nForeign observers are divided on how such a figure could reappear so suddenly. Some speculate foreign backing, others whisper of pure chance and opportunism. Whatever the truth, one thing is certain: a man the world thought buried has returned with a gun in his hand and a province at his feet."
 sndflav.1.a: "The Impossible!"
