 ### Events
 pound.0.d:0 "Welcome to The Pound Presidency. What happens when a 4-times mental hospital patient, pyschedelics user and wannabe-poet makes his own mod? This is the answer! \n\nTo get Ezra Pound as president, wait until the 1936 elections event, and select the third option. Pound will become leader and the ruling ideology will change to fascism. That's it. Coring and release decisions are formable after taking the "All the World a Canvas" focus. It is also reccomended to play on historical for the best experience. \n\nThis mod was made for fun with some friends in a group chat in about 3 weeks work while I finished up my semester, a lot of love went into it and I can only hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did making it! \n\nMod Credits: Indy, Koopa, Deng, Jotell, MacDeko, Stapledonite, OttomanTurks, Verre De Lune, MrSwagBringer, and the very cool testers that I forced at gunpoint to play the mod."
 pound.1.d:0 "Blood ran in Hannibal's gutters. No longer a backburner East Coast river town, Hannibal never imagined itself to be part of a revolution: yet the revolution had come, even to them. As the ASRP's Order Division approached, following flatbed trailers and blaring speakers, no one was left to request permission. It began at dawn with roundups. ASRP cadre, pre-trained weeks earlier, stood at the head of prepared rosters at the city post office. They were not merely party functionaries-shopkeepers, bank tellers, schoolteachers, and vanquished aldermen. At 4:17 AM, the trucks dispersed into residential areas that were still asleep. At dawn, 143 citizens were whisked quietly to the railway depot. Few of them returned. \nPound's directive the night before in his broadcast radio address had been unequivocal: "Let the parasites be cut away from the body politic. Let Hannibal rise again." \nThe pretext soon arrived-the Hannibal Mutual Trust & Savings Bank had collapsed some days earlier , and there was a bank run on the deposits. This was not unique-scores of banks were collapsing each week-but here the ASRP saw opportunity. It was resolved to take bank manager George H. Laramie from his house and accuse him of "financial sabotage and bourgeois hoarding." \n\nDeep in the pasture outside the city, near a decaying grain elevator, Laramie was forced to his knees. ASRP soldiers, witnesses later confirmed, pulled out a bronze crucible, loaded it with scrap gold and melted currency-accumulated from jewelry stripped from Hannibal's richest houses that morning. One officer, barely twenty years old, opened Laramie's mouth with iron pliers while the others poured the molten gold in. His body shook and collapsed, smoking in the summer heat. And that was not the end, heavens not. \nThere was a "People's Tribunal" in the square outside the old Opera House that night. ASRP commissars marched out another dozen citizens: one Methodist minister accused of harboring sedition, three high school teachers "permissive about Pound," and the city library board. It all took twenty-seven minutes. All twelve were shot against the general store's brick wall and left to rot as a warning. Children were forced to witness. \n\nAt night, the local catholic church, the Rotary Club, and the Masonic Lodge went up in flames. No one from the outside intervened. Two months before, the Missouri State Militia had been dissolved. The nearest regular Army unit was 200 miles away and under Pound's command-Pound's command. \nNo foreign comment. No cameras. Only the acrid smell of charred wood, blood, and seared flesh hanging above the Mississippi. And then silence."
 pound.2.d:0 "Interesting news is trickling out of Congress. It seems that the non-aligned party, a wild-card in Pound’s fractious coalition defined more by promotion of scientific government and opposition to the communists than by a unifying ideology, has coalesced around the figure of Howard Scott. Scott is well-known both within and beyond the walls of the capitol as the leader of Technocracy Inc, a movement advocating the complete economic and political restructuring of America on scientific lines. The technocrats have found the source of America’s economic woes in the price system itself, proposing the replacement of fiat currency with a centralized accounting system anchored to the thermodynamics of industrial production, and the allocation of goods to every American citizen based on said system. \n\nScott’s men are viewed with suspicion on both the left and right, with the communists accusing them of deviating from Marxist principles, while the fascists resent their disdain for racial theory. But President Pound has found something attractive in their beliefs. Meetings between the president and Scott concerning the reorganization of the Department of Agriculture are reported to have gone well, with the men bonding over their shared hatred of finance capital. Pound has publicly declared his admiration for the vision of the technocratic state, calling it “poetry in steel, oiled and harmonic”. The engine of Technocracy has sparked to life, and all the world will hear the rumble of its gears."
 pound.3.d:0 "Francis Parker Yockey, a rising and controversial intellectual within the ranks of the American Socialist Republican Party, has been officially appointed to lead its youth wing—the Vanguard League. \n\nThe young yet gifted orator and writer, Yockey, combines and espouses an unyielding commitment to our unique fascism with a radical critique of liberalism and capitalism. His rhetoric has electrified rallies and campus meetings alike, galvanizing a new generation disillusioned with the old order. \n\nWhile some in the party leadership question his ideological purism and provocative ideas, others believe Yockey’s appointment marks a new chapter of both grandiose and revolutionary energy within the ASRP. \n\nWith the Vanguard League now under his direction, the youth movement may soon become a powerful political force—either an asset or a liability."
 pound.4.d:0 "Shocking news is reverberating across the country from the West Coast today, Hollywood has been destroyed! After an ecstatic rally at the Chinese Theater, armed paramilitaries affiliated with the ASRP and Vanguard League flooded the surrounding neighborhood and planted dynamite around several studios, sound stages, and production offices. Fifty were killed and hundreds injured in the explosions and resulting fires. Survivors fleeing the targeted buildings were detained by ASRP men searching for prominent anti-fascists and communists. Eventually twelve producers, six directors, and eight actors were forced-marched down Hollywood Boulevard in the 95-degree heat and hung from the palms along the Walk of Fame with ropes made from film tape. The executioners conducted a brief show-trial for each of their victims, with charges including anti-American sedition, debauchery, race-mixing, and corruption of the young. Recordings of these show trials are now being shown at ASRP lodges around America. \n\nHeavy criticism has been leveled against the LAPD, who failed to intervene in the attack, merely cordoning off the central blocks of Hollywood during the destruction. The chief of police has even been accused of conspiring with the ASRP. Ezra Pound has not released an official statement on the matter, but sources close to the president report him privately saying: “the fever is painful, but the body will thank it after.” Only time will tell what is meant by these words."
 pound.5.d:0 "The storm has broken over Manhattan. This morning, the streets of New York awoke not to the hum of finance and commerce, but to the thundering boots of the American Socialist Republican Party’s Vanguard Legion. With Red, White and Blue banners fluttering between the monoliths of capital, thousands of uniformed paramilitaries marched down Wall Street in tight formation, chanting slogans denouncing the “bourgeois tyranny” that once ruled unchecked from the towers above. \n\nIt began as a demonstration—one of many in recent weeks—but it quickly transformed into something far more decisive. Armed with pipes, sledgehammers, and the fury of a class long trampled, the ASRP militias turned on the financial district with a vengeance. Bank fronts were shattered with rhythmic precision; great glass panels crumbled beneath boots and batons, and the lobbies of Wall Street titans—JP Morgan, Goldman, and their ilk—were engulfed in flame. Banners were hoisted atop burning banks like war trophies, a declaration that the rule of the dollar was at an end. \n\nEyewitnesses report coordinated squads targeting specific businesses and political offices, dragging known financiers, party loyalists of the old regime, and "class traitors" into the streets for public humiliation. Some were beaten, others simply vanished in the chaos. The police—either sympathetic to the ASRP cause or cowed into inaction—offered no resistance. Those who attempted to intervene were swiftly disarmed and absorbed into the tide of red. \n\nFrom atop the broken steps of the New York Stock Exchange, an ASRP local militia leader is reported to have proclaimed a “final reckoning” for the exploiters of the American worker. “No more brokers, no more bailouts—no more blood for banks!” he roared, as the statue of George Washington behind him was defaced with the hammer and torch emblem of the party. \n\nAs smoke curls into the sky, the world watches with horror and awe. The heart of American finance has fallen—not to a foreign invader, but to its own children, armed with ideology, desperation, and fire."
 pound.8.d:0 "The Sun had not even risen over New Olympos, yet Ezra Pound was driven, literally and figuratively, to meet with America's top generals to decide the doctrine for the ground forces of the newly born Social Republic. Pound walked out of his limousine and to the freshly-constructed supreme military office. Pound began to greet and shake hands with the generals, particularly Douglas MacArthur and George Patton, before sitting down. As the conference commenced and went by slowly, the doctrinal divides between MacArthur and Patton began to show until they were outright yelling. \n\nAs MacArthur and Patton’s bickering began to grow increasingly louder and aggressive until the dismayed Pound slammed onto the conference table and shouted, “Will you simpletons shut up for God's sake and stop arguing like fools!?” The room fell into an abrupt silence. Pound took a deep breath before delivering the final verdict:"
 pound.9.d:0 "Perfection. Absolute perfection. America stands anew, the world clean of it's capitalist shackles, and the demonic bloodlines such as the Rothschilds burn in hell. Standing atop the Empire State building, Commander Pound speaks to the masses of not just America, but of all the world. "Compatriots! Are we not victorious?" The Commander spoke. The crowd joyously shouted back: "Never!" \n\n"Brothers and sisters of the Social Republic, today marks the conclusion of our revolution! Those who stood against us are no more, and only glory shall come to my people in the wake of monumental victory!" He continued. Pound went on, boasting of America's "Imperium of the Highest Arts". The people cried out in splendor, for at last their strife has beared fruit. Pound paused, looked back in silence, before ending his speech: "Today, we are Champions, today, we are olympians, having felled the titans once more. Now, I have the most important news of all for you, and that is about the very matter of our country...""
