 ### Events
 pound.0.d:0 "Welcome to The Pound Presidency. What happens when a 4-times mental hospital patient, pyschedelics user and wannabe-poet makes his own mod? This is the answer! \n\nTo get Ezra Pound as president, wait until the 1936 elections event, and select the third option. Pound will become leader and the ruling ideology will change to fascism. That's it. Coring and release decisions are formable after taking the "All the World a Canvas" focus. It is also reccomended to play on historical for the best experience. \n\nThis mod was made for fun with some friends in a group chat in about 3 weeks work while I finished up my semester, a lot of love went into it and I can only hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did making it! \n\nMod Credits: Indy, Koopa, Deng, Jotell, MacDeko, Stapledonite, OttomanTurks, Verre De Lune, MrSwagBringer, and the very cool testers that I forced at gunpoint to play the mod."
 pound.1.d:0 "Blood ran in Hannibal's gutters. No longer a backburner East Coast river town, Hannibal never imagined itself to be part of a revolution: yet the revolution had come, even to them. As the ASRP's Order Division approached, following flatbed trailers and blaring speakers, no one was left to request permission. It began at dawn with roundups. ASRP cadre, pre-trained weeks earlier, stood at the head of prepared rosters at the city post office. They were not merely party functionaries-shopkeepers, bank tellers, schoolteachers, and vanquished aldermen. At 4:17 AM, the trucks dispersed into residential areas that were still asleep. At dawn, 143 citizens were whisked quietly to the railway depot. Few of them returned. \nPound's directive the night before in his broadcast radio address had been unequivocal: "Let the parasites be cut away from the body politic. Let Hannibal rise again." \nThe pretext soon arrived-the Hannibal Mutual Trust & Savings Bank had collapsed some days earlier , and there was a bank run on the deposits. This was not unique-scores of banks were collapsing each week-but here the ASRP saw opportunity. It was resolved to take bank manager George H. Laramie from his house and accuse him of "financial sabotage and bourgeois hoarding." \n\nDeep in the pasture outside the city, near a decaying grain elevator, Laramie was forced to his knees. ASRP soldiers, witnesses later confirmed, pulled out a bronze crucible, loaded it with scrap gold and melted currency-accumulated from jewelry stripped from Hannibal's richest houses that morning. One officer, barely twenty years old, opened Laramie's mouth with iron pliers while the others poured the molten gold in. His body shook and collapsed, smoking in the summer heat. And that was not the end, heavens not. \nThere was a "People's Tribunal" in the square outside the old Opera House that night. ASRP commissars marched out another dozen citizens: one Methodist minister accused of harboring sedition, three high school teachers "permissive about Pound," and the city library board. It all took twenty-seven minutes. All twelve were shot against the general store's brick wall and left to rot as a warning. Children were forced to witness. \n\nAt night, the local catholic church, the Rotary Club, and the Masonic Lodge went up in flames. No one from the outside intervened. Two months before, the Missouri State Militia had been dissolved. The nearest regular Army unit was 200 miles away and under Pound's command-Pound's command. \nNo foreign comment. No cameras. Only the acrid smell of charred wood, blood, and seared flesh hanging above the Mississippi. And then silence."
 pound.2.d:0 "Interesting news is trickling out of Congress. It seems that the non-aligned party, a wild-card in Pound’s fractious coalition defined more by promotion of scientific government and opposition to the communists than by a unifying ideology, has coalesced around the figure of Howard Scott. Scott is well-known both within and beyond the walls of the capitol as the leader of Technocracy Inc, a movement advocating the complete economic and political restructuring of America on scientific lines. The technocrats have found the source of America’s economic woes in the price system itself, proposing the replacement of fiat currency with a centralized accounting system anchored to the thermodynamics of industrial production, and the allocation of goods to every American citizen based on said system. \n\nScott’s men are viewed with suspicion on both the left and right, with the communists accusing them of deviating from Marxist principles, while the fascists resent their disdain for racial theory. But President Pound has found something attractive in their beliefs. Meetings between the president and Scott concerning the reorganization of the Department of Agriculture are reported to have gone well, with the men bonding over their shared hatred of finance capital. Pound has publicly declared his admiration for the vision of the technocratic state, calling it “poetry in steel, oiled and harmonic”. The engine of Technocracy has sparked to life, and all the world will hear the rumble of its gears."
 pound.3.d:0 "Francis Parker Yockey, a rising and controversial intellectual within the ranks of the American Socialist Republican Party, has been officially appointed to lead its youth wing—the Vanguard League. \n\nThe young yet gifted orator and writer, Yockey, combines and espouses an unyielding commitment to our unique fascism with a radical critique of liberalism and capitalism. His rhetoric has electrified rallies and campus meetings alike, galvanizing a new generation disillusioned with the old order. \n\nWhile some in the party leadership question his ideological purism and provocative ideas, others believe Yockey’s appointment marks a new chapter of both grandiose and revolutionary energy within the ASRP. \n\nWith the Vanguard League now under his direction, the youth movement may soon become a powerful political force—either an asset or a liability."
 pound.4.d:0 "Shocking news is reverberating across the country from the West Coast today, Hollywood has been destroyed! After an ecstatic rally at the Chinese Theater, armed paramilitaries affiliated with the ASRP and Vanguard League flooded the surrounding neighborhood and planted dynamite around several studios, sound stages, and production offices. Fifty were killed and hundreds injured in the explosions and resulting fires. Survivors fleeing the targeted buildings were detained by ASRP men searching for prominent anti-fascists and communists. Eventually twelve producers, six directors, and eight actors were forced-marched down Hollywood Boulevard in the 95-degree heat and hung from the palms along the Walk of Fame with ropes made from film tape. The executioners conducted a brief show-trial for each of their victims, with charges including anti-American sedition, debauchery, race-mixing, and corruption of the young. Recordings of these show trials are now being shown at ASRP lodges around America. \n\nHeavy criticism has been leveled against the LAPD, who failed to intervene in the attack, merely cordoning off the central blocks of Hollywood during the destruction. The chief of police has even been accused of conspiring with the ASRP. Ezra Pound has not released an official statement on the matter, but sources close to the president report him privately saying: “the fever is painful, but the body will thank it after.” Only time will tell what is meant by these words."
 pound.5.d:0 "The storm has broken over Manhattan. This morning, the streets of New York awoke not to the hum of finance and commerce, but to the thundering boots of the American Socialist Republican Party’s Vanguard Legion. With Red, White and Blue banners fluttering between the monoliths of capital, thousands of uniformed paramilitaries marched down Wall Street in tight formation, chanting slogans denouncing the “bourgeois tyranny” that once ruled unchecked from the towers above. \n\nIt began as a demonstration—one of many in recent weeks—but it quickly transformed into something far more decisive. Armed with pipes, sledgehammers, and the fury of a class long trampled, the ASRP militias turned on the financial district with a vengeance. Bank fronts were shattered with rhythmic precision; great glass panels crumbled beneath boots and batons, and the lobbies of Wall Street titans—JP Morgan, Goldman, and their ilk—were engulfed in flame. Banners were hoisted atop burning banks like war trophies, a declaration that the rule of the dollar was at an end. \n\nEyewitnesses report coordinated squads targeting specific businesses and political offices, dragging known financiers, party loyalists of the old regime, and "class traitors" into the streets for public humiliation. Some were beaten, others simply vanished in the chaos. The police—either sympathetic to the ASRP cause or cowed into inaction—offered no resistance. Those who attempted to intervene were swiftly disarmed and absorbed into the tide of red. \n\nFrom atop the broken steps of the New York Stock Exchange, an ASRP local militia leader is reported to have proclaimed a “final reckoning” for the exploiters of the American worker. “No more brokers, no more bailouts—no more blood for banks!” he roared, as the statue of George Washington behind him was defaced with the hammer and torch emblem of the party. \n\nAs smoke curls into the sky, the world watches with horror and awe. The heart of American finance has fallen—not to a foreign invader, but to its own children, armed with ideology, desperation, and fire."
 pound.8.d:0 "The Sun had not even risen over New Olympos, yet Ezra Pound was driven, literally and figuratively, to meet with America's top generals to decide the doctrine for the ground forces of the newly born Social Republic. Pound walked out of his limousine and to the freshly-constructed supreme military office. Pound began to greet and shake hands with the generals, particularly Douglas MacArthur and George Patton, before sitting down. As the conference commenced and went by slowly, the doctrinal divides between MacArthur and Patton began to show until they were outright yelling. \n\nAs MacArthur and Patton’s bickering began to grow increasingly louder and aggressive until the dismayed Pound slammed onto the conference table and shouted, “Will you simpletons shut up for God's sake and stop arguing like fools!?” The room fell into an abrupt silence. Pound took a deep breath before delivering the final verdict:"
 pound.9.d:0 "Perfection. Absolute perfection. America stands anew, the world clean of its capitalist shackles, and the demonic bloodlines such as the Rothschilds burn in hell. Standing atop the Empire State building, Commander Pound speaks to the masses of not just America, but of all the world. "Compatriots! Are we not victorious?" The Commander spoke. The crowd joyously shouted back: "Never!" \n\n"Brothers and sisters of the Social Republic, today marks the conclusion of our revolution! Those who stood against us are no more, and only glory shall come to my people in the wake of monumental victory!" He continued. Pound went on, boasting of America's "Imperium of the Highest Arts". The people cried out in splendor, for at last their strife has beared fruit. Pound paused, looked back in silence, before ending his speech: "Today, we are Champions, today, we are olympians, having felled the titans once more. Now, I have the most important news of all for you, and that is about the very matter of our country...""
 pound.12.d: "The morning mist over Williamsburg, Virginia, was broken by the roar of engines as Ezra Pound’s funeral procession bore down from the north. Old men tottered to the windows, rubbing the sleep from their eyes, and children peeked behind half open doors as hundreds of cars, painted in somber, lusterless black, rattled down pitted, rain-washed Jamestown road towards the historic site bearing the same name a few miles south. In the center of the procession, flanked by triple-columns of ASRP men in gold-braided black uniforms, was Pound’s hearse. A monster of an automobile flying the national flag and carrying an open coffin in its bed. The Poet’s will had been absolutely clear. His body was not to rot in a hermetic chamber, suffocated like a forgotten houseplant. He was to travel open to the world, watched by the same skies, wept over by the same rains that had seen the rise of his kingdom. The residents watched, transfixed. No one uttered a word. Even the children could feel the unspeakable weight of the moment. Even they felt, in an obscure, fitful way, that they had become part of something greater, as if they had been lifted out of their trivial lives and dropped into the pages of a myth. For a moment, history had gathered the people of Williamsburg into its embrace. Then the procession vanished down the road, and they retreated back into their shadowy houses, dazed, unsure if they had really seen it in the first place. \n\nIn Jamestown, beside the ruined, lichen-flowered walls of the Ambler Mansion, Howard Scott’s engineers had assembled a mighty creamtory. Scott, draped in his perpetual gray overcoat, paced back and forth like a stormcloud, his sharp eyes glittering with plans and stratagems that would have been unthinkable a mere week ago. He snapped to attention as the funeral procession roared into the field, ordering his men to form a line on the southern edge of the clearing. The first to emerge from the vehicles was Francis Parker Yockey, clad in a luxuriant uniform armed in all the symbols of might and majesty. Despite the overcast sky, his eyes were shielded by sunglasses. He was followed by Hemingway and what looked like a band of rustic cowherds, identifiable as socialist partisans only by their red handkerchiefs. Scott couldn’t believe his eyes, the two men refused to even be in the same room in the capitol, yet here they were, working side by side as they carefully removed Pound’s coffin from the hearse. Together, Yockey on the right and Hemmingway on the left, each followed by two of their militiamen, they carried Pound’s casket to the crematory. Unwilling to be outdone, Scott himself cranked the lever that opened the furnace gates. A blast of heat punctuated the chill air, withering the heads of the dandelions that grew around the cast-iron behemoth. For a moment Scott saw the face of the Poet, impossibly young and handsome, gleaming in the golden light of the flames. Before the door slammed shut. A wraith of smoke trailed out of the chimney towards the pale unblemished sky, Pound’s spirit going to join the settlers of Jamestown, the first flicker of the nation that he had brought to its apotheosis. George W. Christians, the last of Pound’s favorites, emerged from a car near the back of the procession and walked to the center of the field, reading from a scroll inscribed with exquisitely ornate, multicolored calligraphy. He had no militia with him, his movement was still too small and too isolated. But he had been given the honor of reading from Pound’s Cantos to mark his death. Scott had never been much for poetry, but he listened patiently and with unfeigned respect. Hemmingway had a bitter, impenetrable expression on his usually cheerful face, and Yockey… could it be. Scott squinted just to make sure he wasn’t seeing things. Yes, there was no mistaking the glimmer of tears on Yockey’s cheeks. \n\nThey stood there until morning, listening to Christians’s slow but not unpleasant voice, conscious of an epoch that was passing. This moment was only the calm before the storm, Soon all four of them would be locked in a life or death struggle, and whoever was victorious would shape the destiny of not just America, but the world."
 pound.13.d: "Ezra Pound sat cross-legged beneath the vault of a Florentine palazzo, a burning censer of myrrh and benzoin fogging the air. His hosts—a motley of occultists, forgotten nobles, and one or two old poets gone mad—murmured in tongues both ancient and invented. A procession began. Silent. Disjointed. Figures in papal mitres and flayed masks drifted past, trailing incense and petals of something that smelled like ancient libraries. One bore a cage filled with moths; another, a mirrored cube. \nPound had taken something. Psilocybin, perhaps. Or ergot scraped from the spine of a buried saint. He didn’t ask. He didn't want to ask. \nThe procession looped. Time folded. Dorian syllables emerged from the ether, then shattered into gold dust. Pound’s eyes widened. He saw a tower of Babel built from cantos—his cantos—rising and collapsing in fractal rhythm. There was a sea of bankers drowning. Then a woman without a face reciting Arnaut Daniel in hexameter. \nThe walls breathed. Then wept. \nA pale hand reached from the shadows and offered him a bronze mask. He placed it on. A jolt. He was now among the procession—no longer watcher but watched. They bowed to him. The flayed man whispered: “You have seen the shape of the Real.” \nPound staggered back. \nHe escaped the room—a womb of velvet and moans—and found the hallway leading to the balcony. The cold night struck him like a psalm. The Duomo’s dome was a half-lidded eye. Stars wheeled, not by physics, but in cadence. \n\nBelow, leaning on a streetlamp as if waiting for a ferry across the Lethe, stood Bill Bailey. A man of hats and hard intentions. He wasn’t smiling. His hand gripped a long-nosed revolver. \n\nThey locked eyes. Bill had followed Pound since the early days, since the broadcasts. Since Italy. \nPound’s hand went slowly to his coat, where the weight of an old Walther pressed against his ribs. \nThe moon was full. The procession behind him moaned in ecstasy. Somewhere, a harp string broke, and the world held its breath."
 pound.14.d: "In the twilight of America’s old republic, amid the smoke of a broken economy and the rising chorus of political fanatics, a poet took the reins of power. President Ezra Pound, laureate turned autocrat, presided over the American Social Republic from the frescoed halls of the re-imagined Capitol—its dome now crowned with a silver eagle clutching lightning bolts, a symbol of his fusion of intellect and iron. \n\nIt was the year 1938. Washington had not seen peace in years. Pound's ascent was as improbable as it was inevitable: his voice, once confined to stanzas and radio broadcasts from fascist Italy, now ruled by decree. Under his regime, literature was law, and currency was backed by silver and verse. Banks were dismantled, and "usura" was outlawed with near-religious zeal. \n\nThe Silver Legion, remnants of a minor fascist movement led by William Dudley Pelley, operated from the Appalachian highlands. Draped in silver shirts and mystical rhetoric, they styled themselves as a righteous militia prepared to "cleanse the spirit of the nation." But to Pound, their theatrics were an eyesore—dangerous in their potential, but pitiful in their execution. \n\nOne foggy January morning, a courier arrived at Pelley's stronghold in western North Carolina, riding in a sleek, black Harley motorcycle, its sidecar emblazoned with the sigil of the Office of Rhetoric and Security. The message was hand-typed on thick, cream-coloured paper: \n\nFrom the Office of the President, Ezra Pound, Supreme Poet of the American Social Republic \nTo: Commander William Dudley Pelley, Silver Legion \nYou exist by indulgence. Submit or be obliterated. \nThe metaphysical state has no room for parasites. Your theatrics are noted. \nour dogmatic mysticism is obsolete. \nYou have 48 hours. \n\n–Ezra \n\nPelley read the message twice, eyes narrowing beneath the crisp brim of his silver cap. Around him, lieutenants fidgeted. He had always fancied himself a seer, a spiritual warrior. But this—this was a test he hadn’t foreseen in his automatic writings. He knew the stories. The annihilation of the Oklahoma Redoubt. The "Re-Education" of the Jeffersonians in the Mojave. When Ezra made a threat, it came cloaked in metaphor and carried out with artillery. \n\nHe submitted. \n\nTwo days later, Pelley boarded a state airship from Atlanta, escorted by the black-uniformed ASRP militias. His destination: Paraguay, where he would serve as "Cultural Liaison and Ambassador of American Hermeneutics." An exile dressed in honor. \n\nIn Asunción, he would sit in an embassy adorned with tapestries of Pound’s Cantos, drinking maté with bewildered Paraguayan ministers, issuing proclamations no one read. Occasionally, he would write home, his words filtered and annotated by censors before reaching American eyes. \nBack home, Pound read the reports with a quiet smirk. The Silver Legion had become a footnote—an asterisk in the margins of his grand poetic empire. The republic marched on, its new hymnbooks filled not with anthems, but verse."

While you may try to fight the British and defeat them conventionally, there is in-fact a scripted peace deal which will allow you to force a surrender from London. These are the following requirements to get the scripted peace event: \n\nYour navy must be 2x the size as Britain's. \nYour army must be 2x the size of Britain's. \nYou must have inflicted over 300,000 casualties on Britain. \nBritain's Faction must be have half the strength Ratio as their enemies. \nEITHER any core state of Britain is controlled by you, OR Bermuda, Belize, Suez, Gibralter, and Malta are NOT controlled by Britain. \nEITHER Canada must have capitulated already, OR does not exist on-map. \nYou must have at least 100 ships in both the English Channel and Western Approaches. \nFinally, all of YOUR core states must be controlled by you (USA tag). \nWait around 20 days, and the event should fire."
 yock.1.d: "The state of the national media immediately prior to Francis Parker Yockey’s ascension to power could only have been described as frantic. The various leftists and minorities who had enjoyed an uncertain existence under the Poet-king now faced a certain and imminent threat, for Yockey and his Vanguad had made it abundantly clear there would be no room for undesirables in his austere ethnocultural empire. However, after Yockey’s inauguration, the news abruptly went silent for a period of several weeks. When it resumed, it was eerily altered. Every paper, from local bulletins to the national presses spoke in the same hollow, obsequious tone, singing the praises of Yockey and the glory he would bring to America. The fates of Yockey’s left-wing opposition, the formerly popular George W. Christians and Ernest Hemingway, were glossed over in no more than a few short paragraphs. Christians had been declared insane and swallowed into the labyrinth of America’s psychiatric-industrial complex. While Hemingway had been charged with treason and an execution squad dispatched to his lodge in Idaho. It appears the great writer didn’t go down without the fight, as the names of eight slain Vanguard troopers were listed alongside the statement."
 yock.2.d: "They gathered not in reverence, but in rapture. The Capitol no longer housed democracy, but divinity—a state reborn in black and bronze. On a raised plinth, beneath fluttering banners stitched with the solar eagle and the iron fasces, Francis Parker Yockey addressed the American people. \n\n“We stand at the frontier—not of geography, but of destiny. The old republic is dead, its bones scattered from San Francisco to the Potomac. In its place, something greater rises. A state not built on votes or commerce, but on spirit, hierarchy, and vision. \n\nThis is not a war of armies alone. It is a war of metaphysics. London—the rotting core of Anglo-financial hypocrisy—shall burn. Moscow—the barbarian forge of materialist decadence—shall be ground to ash. Against both, we declare not opposition, but annihilation. \n\nYou, Americans of the Imperium, will become the sword. You will know hardship, yes. But from it, glory. Total Mobilization. Absolute devotion. Every hand forges victory; every voice affirms truth. \n\nWe are no longer a nation. We are an idea with steel sinews, marching across the continents. \n\nLet them call us mad. Let them call us monsters. They are not wrong. For only monsters can tear down the world that was. And only monsters, tempered in will and faith, can forge the world to come. \n\nAnd when they ask what we fight for, what we believe, what we dream—tell them: \n\nMore than anything you can even yet imagine.” \n\nThe crowd did not cheer—they howled. They chanted. \n“Imperium! Imperium! Imperium!” \n\nThe black banners of America marched toward total war."
 #butler.1.d: "Patience runs dry. No amount of sing-songy or artsy-fartsy display of national brilliance nor pride can win the masses if you do not provide their beloved bread and circuses. Pound's arrogance has caught up with him, and with a seeming inability to fix the great depression and "Surpass material strife", the people are more than outraged. The last straw came when Pound revealed several war plans, including potential alliances with fascist powers. While MacArthur and Patton were eager to hear Pound's ambitions, Smedley Butler was horrified; After an intense argument, Butler was sacked from the American Legion - A mistake no fool should make. The noble wrath of now not just the people, but the military and veterans who had supported Pound now too turn on him. \n\nThe people march down the Streets of the capitol shouting "Utopia? I don't give a damn!" to mock the fascist party. Now, Butler approaches with 10,000 American Legion men, the military and police tipped off and uncaring for the madman about to be deposed. As Butler Strode into the "Commander's Palace" - a decadent construction made for Pound's ego - He wondered how he might be remembered in history. He was doing the right thing, no? Yet now he was likely to be dictator - Roosevelt and the previous adminsitration lay dead or are missing persons, and the thought of so much power, so much responsibility irked the old Smedley. \n\n It was easy. Pound broke down as soon as the battalions broke into his quarters. He was grabbed and beat. Then held on the ground and handcuffed. "Former President- Forgive me God for saying this- Former 'Commander' of America, Ezra Loomis Pound, you are under arrest and sentenced to trial before the supreme court of the United States. You know what you have done, and we believe the power of popular will to be of due justice to you. You have the right to remain silent." \n\nPound didn't speak, merely staring down. It was over. And it was not coming back."
