peacedeal.1.t: "The Soviets Ask for Peace!"
peacedeal.1.d: "Our advances across Russia have been decisive and crushing, and we have come to occupy the majority of western Russia. With the Red Army now fully on the retreat, their government has come to us with a proposal of their surrender, practically begging for mercy. This would cede us most land up to the Astrakhan-Archangelsk line, fulling the destruction of bolshevism in Europe. Do we accept their surrender?"
peacedeal.1.a: "Accept the offer. Deutschland, erwache!"
peacedeal.1.b: "No peace for Bolshevik monsters!"
